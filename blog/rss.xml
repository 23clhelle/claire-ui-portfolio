This specifically came from chapter 7 of Don't Make Me Think. I found this really interesting because the way it describes the speed at which users determine if a site is good enough. Immediately from first impressions, users determine if they like a design or not. And their impression of the site won't change if they look at even more. I find this really facinating because I wouldn't have expected that even though I know from my own experience that I do the same thing when opening a new site.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[When reading this article, I was really struck by the information about giving feedback. Specifically, how you must have a positive relationship with the person first if you want to give them negative feedback that they will actually utilize. We discussed giving and recieving feedback in a leadership class I took last semester and I find that there is a lot of good overlap with this article. We discussed how you must "be in the arena" with someone if you want to give them feedback. Being in the arena simply means that you genuinely want what's best for them and are trying to help them improve. This article essetially says the same thing which I think is really important to know especially when it comes to being in a leadership position.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Word: Whitespace]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Word: Whitespace</p>
<p>This reading made me think a lot about whitespace. Whitespace is a very important tool when it comes to design and I think these portfolios make great use of it. Using whitespace helps direct the eye to the important things on the screen. It also allows for a less overwhelming experience. This article has shown me that I need to be sure to utilize whitespace intentially and percisely in my portfolio. Below I included an image of a portfolio example from the website that utilizes a large amount pf whitespace in a great way.</p>

However, once you navigate to a subsection, this hierarchy is no longer displayed, which is exactly what was pointed out in the chapter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For this blog, I visited the Sheldon Museum of Art in Lincoln, Nebraska. After viewing many different pieces of art, I was struck with inspiration when I saw the Barns and Farms piece.
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="plot" src="https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/assets/images/Barns_And_Farms-edbd7343c8d43186faa692efbee82216.jpeg" width="2351" height="1997" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Barns and Farms is an oil painting on canvas created in 1983. Richard Diebenkorn created the background of this piece, while Ed Ruscha added the text onto the top. The color blocks in the background represent the ocean and sand from the Los Angeles neighborhood where Diebenkorn grew up. Ruscha added the large, capital block letters to depict the agricultural structures he saw when driving from Oklahoma to California.</p>
<p>Color: <br>
<!-- -->Most of the colors’ values are darker, which is nice because it makes the lighter values stand out. These lighter values do a great job of making the painting look more realistic and like there is real light reflecting off of it. I also really like the color choices of blue and orange/yellow because they complement each other very well. Proven because they are true complimentary colors.<br>
<a href="https://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/formal_analysis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/formal_analysis.html</a></p>
<p>Textual: <br>
<!-- -->Barns and Farms provides text that serves a clear purpose. The three words chosen, barns and farms, to be included are simple but do a great job of conveying the message about agriculture. I like that they are about agricultural structures while also rhyming. The harsh block letters are a great stylistic choice because they stand out while being blocky, like agricultural buildings (barns and farms). <br>

<p>Visual Balance: <br>
<!-- -->My eye is immediately drawn to the word barn because that is the largest color contrast of white on dark blue. After that, my eyes are drawn to the yellow/orange color because it is brighter and sticks out since the majority of the piece is dark. I think this does a great job of pointing out the two most important parts of the piece that help convey the meaning. <br>
<a href="https://www.johnlovett.com/balance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.johnlovett.com/balance</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="plot" src="https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/assets/images/Art_Interface_Sketch-175ef7de695adedcf4508c64d79ca58a.jpeg" width="3291" height="2113" class="img_ev3q">
This is the UI I decided to sketch based on the Barns and Farms art piece. This UI has mostly dark backgrounds except for where the heading is. I made the heading lighter to draw the eyes' attention to that spot as the painting did. I also created it so that the most contrast was the bold black text on the light yellow background because that also draws the viewer's attention to that spot. I added wobbly lines separating the heading and footer from the body to reflect the natural curvature of a landscape. The purpose of this interface is to provide information about a landscaping company, so making it look like a landscape, helps convey that purpose. These design choices were all based on the aspects I noticed from the Barns and Farms painting. This UI could be used on just about any device, but given the shape I sketched the interface, it would match best with a computer screen.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, I learned a lot about design. One noteworthy aspect was the connection between art and interface design. I never thought about how web pages and apps are a form of art. When designing these interfaces, the designer has to think about the aspects of art that they can incorporate to better communicate their message.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Through reading several articles from designsystems.com, I learned about many different design strategies. One that really stuck out to me was an article about typography. This article discussed various ways to display text and what to consider when choosing how to do so. The article suggests keeping your list of font variations short. This really stuck out to me because I had never considered it to be an issue. But when I thought about it, it made a lot of sense that you should only include a few font types in your interface. I thought about other interfaces I've interacted with, and they follow this rule very well.</p>
<p>I decided to create an interface that did not follow these rules.
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="plot" src="https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/assets/images/Bad_Fonts_Image-6cda8560598e80327e8b7751d4e01045.jpg" width="1543" height="998" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This interface consists of multiple font types and sizes. Each text box has a different font type, and the hierarchy is not logical. The less critical information is larger than the heading and utilizes all capitalized letters. This is a very poor interface design because the more important information should stick out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Apple website has a very sleek interface. The following blog dives into what makes the interface look good and other potential color schemes it could use.</p>
<p>The original interface:
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="plot" src="https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/assets/images/OriginalApple-0ac18a1a9f00235a5406d44a87a9c5e0.png" width="1840" height="918" class="img_ev3q">
The original color scheme is pretty bland. Most of the interface is black, white, and gray with the exception of the image and some blue text indicating a link. So, this interface mostly follows the achromatic scheme. This scheme really helps to convey professionalism and sleekness from the company.</p>
<p>My recreation of the interface:
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="plot" src="https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/assets/images/RecreationApple-7acff017c99b13afcbde348e38e79820.png" width="1842" height="918" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Color scheme version 1:
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="plot" src="https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/assets/images/Version1Apple-8087ffb6a91ebcabfbe1f669bbbdc81b.png" width="1840" height="924" class="img_ev3q">
I changed the colors to create a more magical interface. Violet is a great way of conveying a magical feeling so I chose to create a monochromatic look with violet.</p>
<p>Color scheme version 2:
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="plot" src="https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/assets/images/Version2Apple-fac1241757c3abad47c28c0571257927.png" width="1840" height="924" class="img_ev3q">
For this version, I changed the colors to make the interface more calm. Using the color light blue is a great way to emanate a calm feeling. I chose to use light tints of the three primary colors to create a cohesive interface that promoted a calm feeling.</p>
<p>Color scheme version 3:
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="plot" src="https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/assets/images/Version3Apple-cf66e19b7de8a4aa6c619653510f1fdb.png" width="1838" height="938" class="img_ev3q">
On the final version, I attempted to follow a rich color scheme. I wanted to focus on burgundy as the powerful hue and I paired it with its darkened complement of a forest green. This color scheme works to create a dramatic interface that is unforgettable.</p>
<p>Conclusion:
I think the original version is the most effective because it’s color scheme is the most appealing to me. Apple is a very sleek, high-end company and I think the black and white color scheme does a great job of keeping the website professional. Adding the pop of color through the phones is nice because it draws the eye to the phones which are the star of the show. The user came to the site to look at accessories and they were able to see how a few accessories can be used on their phones.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Analogy: Signal is to noise as accessibility is to barriers.</p>
<p>You want a high signal to noise ratio, but it's important to acknowledge that in some circumstances noise is good. Noise can help convey the theme or message you are trying to get across. Just as accessibility is important almost always, but sometimes you need barriers to limit access. For instance, there are employee only sections in a store so you use a door as a barrier to separate that part of the store from the rest. Or in UI, there is a teacher side of canvas that you don't want students to have access to so you make a barrier at the log in screen to prevent students from seeing the teachers side. It's important for me to remember this in my career because I want to efficiently and effectively convey my message when designing things like presentations or even applications.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Section: Aspects of Color</p>
<p>Word: Manipulation</p>
<p>I chose manipulation to describe this section because it is all about identifying how colors affect and influence people. Not only do colors affect peoples' emotions, but they affect our physical health too. This can be our blood pressure, metabolism, and more. Designers can use this as a way of manipulating people who are viewing their product or brand. It's important for me to remember this in my career because anytime I make a presentation or a logo, I can use color to portray my message effectively. Simply using blue as a theme for my presentation can provide calming effects to my audience and me.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Section: Color Trends</p>
<p>Word: Social Media</p>
<p>Technically social media is two words but it's one thing so I'm going to count it anyway. This section made me think about social media a lot because of how it wrote about CAUS and tracking trends. They talk about having people visit places to determine what the popular fashion trends are to determine the color trends. This is a fairly old book though so I kept thinking about how social media would change the way they operate. Especially with the rise of influencers and celebrities, I feel like social media would be a very important, and probably more convenient way, to track trends and predict future color trends.</p>
