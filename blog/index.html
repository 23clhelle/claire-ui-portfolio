Yet with that, it's vital to know that user testing isn't such a big deal to the point where you put it off in the beginning stages. The main part that I found noteworthy though was understanding why you need user tests. When you are the creator of anything, eventually you forget what other people will think of it when they see it for the first time. So, when you are creating an interface, you will forget that the purpose of some buttons or certain navigations isn't obvious, So it's important to see how a user would interact with your interface without any prior knowledge.","datePublished":"2024-10-23T20:00:00.000Z","author":[],"keywords":[]},{"@type":"BlogPosting","@id":"https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/Mockups-blog-post","mainEntityOfPage":"https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/Mockups-blog-post","url":"https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/Mockups-blog-post","headline":"Mockups Blog Post","name":"Mockups Blog Post","description":"Something that really stuck out to me when I was doing this reading was the Big Bang Theory of Web Design.

Immediately from first impressions, users determine if they like a design or not. And their impression of the site won't change if they look at even more.

We discussed how you must \"be in the arena\" with someone if you want to give them feedback. Being in the arena simply means that you genuinely want what's best for them and are trying to help them improve.

I also read about values from Colin Brek’s blog. What really stuck out to me this week was the navigation hierarchy. When I think about websites I typically use, there’s normally a navigation bar at the top with subsections within it. However, once you navigate to a subsection, this hierarchy is no longer displayed, which is exactly what was pointed out in the chapter. While I find this inconsistency to be very frustrating, I can understand why it’s less important. Users will spend the majority of time on the pages towards the top of the hierarchy, making the lower levels less important.","datePublished":"2024-10-07T15:00:00.000Z","author":[],"keywords":[]},{"@type":"BlogPosting","@id":"https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/FindingInspiration-blog-post","mainEntityOfPage":"https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/FindingInspiration-blog-post","url":"https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/FindingInspiration-blog-post","headline":"Finding Inspiration","name":"Finding Inspiration","description":"For this blog, I visited the Sheldon Museum of Art in Lincoln, Nebraska.

Each student in the class chose a different population to represent for this mock negotiation. The prior week, we all presented the populations we were serving and what kind of needs they have. So, by Monday, we all had an idea of how we were going to negotiate the requirements of our hypothetical interface.
I chose to represent the population that has dyslexia. Dyslexia is a condition that makes processing written words more difficult. So, I did some research on what an interface would need to help users with dyslexia. What I found was that they could benefit from sans-serif fonts, larger font sizes, simple backgrounds, large contrast levels, and text-to-speech functionality.</p>
<p>So, back to the mock negotiation. My teacher sent out a slide show with different sections where we could add our requirements. The sections included a color scheme, menu, media, etc. I was quick to add my five requirements to the presentation. They were also in priority order, so since I was quick, they ended up being a high priority. However, there were times when the priorities got moved, but I always understood why they needed to be moved and I was able to easily prioritize the dyslexic population&#x27;s needs because of my research. Then, my teacher gave us the challenge of limiting how many we could agree to add to the hypothetical website as a group. All of my requirements were included through some compromise except for the text-to-speech functionality, but that was mainly due to time constraints and because it was on the last slide. I was surprised to have the photosensitivity population agree with me on requirements, but when I thought about it, it made sense because of the high-contrast level requirement. It was hard to convince anxiety’s representative of my requirements because we didn’t have any overlap at the start. But, with time, they understood that some of the requirements were very necessary.</p>
<p>While I will never be in this exact situation again, I learned some valuable insights from it. The main thing being how to reason with people who don’t have the same goals as you. I had to find a way to appeal to their emotions because I knew the logic wouldn’t benefit me in this situation. After a while of negotiation, I determined how to persuade the other representatives to add my requirements to the website. I’ll be able to use these persuasive tactics in many different situations in the future.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/freeform">FreeForm</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/inclusive-design-2-blog-post">Inclusive Design 2 Blog Post</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-10-29T20:30:00.000Z">October 29, 2024</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p>In this chapter, one important piece of information in discusses is the four different kinds of constraints.

Each person prefers a particular element/design, and it is really difficult to change their mind. So, when these issues arise, the only may to come to a conclusion is to test it with users. You must determine if the specific element makes sense with the design, use case, and context. Without testing, the debate within the team will drag on, and it will be impossible to ever come to an agreement.</p>

Yet with that, it&#x27;s vital to know that user testing isn&#x27;t such a big deal to the point where you put it off in the beginning stages. The main part that I found noteworthy though was understanding why you need user tests. When you are the creator of anything, eventually you forget what other people will think of it when they see it for the first time. So, when you are creating an interface, you will forget that the purpose of some buttons or certain navigations isn&#x27;t obvious, So it&#x27;s important to see how a user would interact with your interface without any prior knowledge.</p>

This specifically came from chapter 7 of Don&#x27;t Make Me Think. I found this really interesting because the way it describes the speed at which users determine if a site is good enough. Immediately from first impressions, users determine if they like a design or not. And their impression of the site won&#x27;t change if they look at even more. I find this really facinating because I wouldn&#x27;t have expected that even though I know from my own experience that I do the same thing when opening a new site.</p>

Specifically, how you must have a positive relationship with the person first if you want to give them negative feedback that they will actually utilize. We discussed giving and recieving feedback in a leadership class I took last semester and I find that there is a lot of good overlap with this article. We discussed how you must &quot;be in the arena&quot; with someone if you want to give them feedback. Being in the arena simply means that you genuinely want what&#x27;s best for them and are trying to help them improve. This article essetially says the same thing which I think is really important to know especially when it comes to being in a leadership position.</p>

<p>This reading made me think a lot about whitespace. Whitespace is a very important tool when it comes to design and I think these portfolios make great use of it. Using whitespace helps direct the eye to the important things on the screen. It also allows for a less overwhelming experience. This article has shown me that I need to be sure to utilize whitespace intentially and percisely in my portfolio. Below I included an image of a portfolio example from the website that utilizes a large amount pf whitespace in a great way.</p>

I also read about values from Colin Brek’s blog. What really stuck out to me this week was the navigation hierarchy. When I think about websites I typically use, there’s normally a navigation bar at the top with subsections within it. However, once you navigate to a subsection, this hierarchy is no longer displayed, which is exactly what was pointed out in the chapter. While I find this inconsistency to be very frustrating, I can understand why it’s less important. Users will spend the majority of time on the pages towards the top of the hierarchy, making the lower levels less important.</p>

After viewing many different pieces of art, I was struck with inspiration when I saw the Barns and Farms piece.
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="plot" src="/claire-ui-portfolio/assets/images/Barns_And_Farms-edbd7343c8d43186faa692efbee82216.jpeg" width="2351" height="1997" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Barns and Farms is an oil painting on canvas created in 1983. Richard Diebenkorn created the background of this piece, while Ed Ruscha added the text onto the top. The color blocks in the background represent the ocean and sand from the Los Angeles neighborhood where Diebenkorn grew up. Ruscha added the large, capital block letters to depict the agricultural structures he saw when driving from Oklahoma to California.</p>
<p>Color: <br>
<!-- -->Most of the colors’ values are darker, which is nice because it makes the lighter values stand out. These lighter values do a great job of making the painting look more realistic and like there is real light reflecting off of it. I also really like the color choices of blue and orange/yellow because they complement each other very well. Proven because they are true complimentary colors.<br>

<p>Textual: <br>
<!-- -->Barns and Farms provides text that serves a clear purpose. The three words chosen, barns and farms, to be included are simple but do a great job of conveying the message about agriculture. I like that they are about agricultural structures while also rhyming. The harsh block letters are a great stylistic choice because they stand out while being blocky, like agricultural buildings (barns and farms). <br>

<p>Visual Balance: <br>
<!-- -->My eye is immediately drawn to the word barn because that is the largest color contrast of white on dark blue. After that, my eyes are drawn to the yellow/orange color because it is brighter and sticks out since the majority of the piece is dark. I think this does a great job of pointing out the two most important parts of the piece that help convey the meaning. <br>

This is the UI I decided to sketch based on the Barns and Farms art piece. This UI has mostly dark backgrounds except for where the heading is. I made the heading lighter to draw the eyes&#x27; attention to that spot as the painting did. I also created it so that the most contrast was the bold black text on the light yellow background because that also draws the viewer&#x27;s attention to that spot. I added wobbly lines separating the heading and footer from the body to reflect the natural curvature of a landscape. The purpose of this interface is to provide information about a landscaping company, so making it look like a landscape, helps convey that purpose. These design choices were all based on the aspects I noticed from the Barns and Farms painting. This UI could be used on just about any device, but given the shape I sketched the interface, it would match best with a computer screen.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, I learned a lot about design. One noteworthy aspect was the connection between art and interface design. I never thought about how web pages and apps are a form of art. When designing these interfaces, the designer has to think about the aspects of art that they can incorporate to better communicate their message.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">About Me</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/about-me">About Me</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Projects</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/projects">Projects</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Blog</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/blog">Blog</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/your-org/my-ui-portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 My UI Portfolio.
