Physical constraints limit the number of potential actions. They are most effective when they are easy to see and interpret because you want to prevent the user from even attempting the action. Cultural constraints are defined by the user’s culture. They determine what actions make sense given their cultural experience. Culture is constantly evolving, and so are constraints. Semantic constraints are defined by the meaning of the situation controlling potential actions. They rely on users’ knowledge of the world. These constraints can also change with time. Logical constraints are defined by what makes logical sense to the user. It has to do with the relationship between the spatial or functional layout of components. These are the four types of constraints that can be utilized by designers to make their UI more beneficial and helpful for the user.","datePublished":"2024-10-29T20:30:00.000Z","author":[],"keywords":[]},{"@type":"BlogPosting","@id":"https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/inclusive-design-1-blog-post","mainEntityOfPage":"https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/inclusive-design-1-blog-post","url":"https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/inclusive-design-1-blog-post","headline":"Inclusive Design 1 Blog Post","name":"Inclusive Design 1 Blog Post","description":"This chapter brings awareness to accessibility on websites.

Yet with that, it's vital to know that user testing isn't such a big deal to the point where you put it off in the beginning stages. The main part that I found noteworthy though was understanding why you need user tests. When you are the creator of anything, eventually you forget what other people will think of it when they see it for the first time. So, when you are creating an interface, you will forget that the purpose of some buttons or certain navigations isn't obvious, So it's important to see how a user would interact with your interface without any prior knowledge.","datePublished":"2024-10-23T20:00:00.000Z","author":[],"keywords":[]},{"@type":"BlogPosting","@id":"https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/Mockups-blog-post","mainEntityOfPage":"https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/Mockups-blog-post","url":"https://23clhelle.github.io/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/Mockups-blog-post","headline":"Mockups Blog Post","name":"Mockups Blog Post","description":"Something that really stuck out to me when I was doing this reading was the Big Bang Theory of Web Design.

We discussed how you must \"be in the arena\" with someone if you want to give them feedback. Being in the arena simply means that you genuinely want what's best for them and are trying to help them improve.

Each student in the class chose a different population to represent for this mock negotiation. The prior week, we all presented the populations we were serving and what kind of needs they have. So, by Monday, we all had an idea of how we were going to negotiate the requirements of our hypothetical interface.
I chose to represent the population that has dyslexia. Dyslexia is a condition that makes processing written words more difficult. So, I did some research on what an interface would need to help users with dyslexia. What I found was that they could benefit from sans-serif fonts, larger font sizes, simple backgrounds, large contrast levels, and text-to-speech functionality.</p>
<p>So, back to the mock negotiation. My teacher sent out a slide show with different sections where we could add our requirements. The sections included a color scheme, menu, media, etc. I was quick to add my five requirements to the presentation. They were also in priority order, so since I was quick, they ended up being a high priority. However, there were times when the priorities got moved, but I always understood why they needed to be moved and I was able to easily prioritize the dyslexic population&#x27;s needs because of my research. Then, my teacher gave us the challenge of limiting how many we could agree to add to the hypothetical website as a group. All of my requirements were included through some compromise except for the text-to-speech functionality, but that was mainly due to time constraints and because it was on the last slide. I was surprised to have the photosensitivity population agree with me on requirements, but when I thought about it, it made sense because of the high-contrast level requirement. It was hard to convince anxiety’s representative of my requirements because we didn’t have any overlap at the start. But, with time, they understood that some of the requirements were very necessary.</p>
<p>While I will never be in this exact situation again, I learned some valuable insights from it. The main thing being how to reason with people who don’t have the same goals as you. I had to find a way to appeal to their emotions because I knew the logic wouldn’t benefit me in this situation. After a while of negotiation, I determined how to persuade the other representatives to add my requirements to the website. I’ll be able to use these persuasive tactics in many different situations in the future.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/freeform">FreeForm</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/inclusive-design-2-blog-post">Inclusive Design 2 Blog Post</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-10-29T20:30:00.000Z">October 29, 2024</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p>In this chapter, one important piece of information in discusses is the four different kinds of constraints. Physical constraints limit the number of potential actions. They are most effective when they are easy to see and interpret because you want to prevent the user from even attempting the action. Cultural constraints are defined by the user’s culture. They determine what actions make sense given their cultural experience. Culture is constantly evolving, and so are constraints. Semantic constraints are defined by the meaning of the situation controlling potential actions. They rely on users’ knowledge of the world. These constraints can also change with time. Logical constraints are defined by what makes logical sense to the user. It has to do with the relationship between the spatial or functional layout of components. These are the four types of constraints that can be utilized by designers to make their UI more beneficial and helpful for the user.</p>

Krug has a three-second accessibility test that he uses to quickly tell if a website is accessible. This test is simple, hence the name, and simply involves looking if you can make to site&#x27;s text bigger. Having adjustable text size is a fairly simple implementation that greatly benefits users who need it.</p>

Each person prefers a particular element/design, and it is really difficult to change their mind. So, when these issues arise, the only may to come to a conclusion is to test it with users. You must determine if the specific element makes sense with the design, use case, and context. Without testing, the debate within the team will drag on, and it will be impossible to ever come to an agreement.</p>

Yet with that, it&#x27;s vital to know that user testing isn&#x27;t such a big deal to the point where you put it off in the beginning stages. The main part that I found noteworthy though was understanding why you need user tests. When you are the creator of anything, eventually you forget what other people will think of it when they see it for the first time. So, when you are creating an interface, you will forget that the purpose of some buttons or certain navigations isn&#x27;t obvious, So it&#x27;s important to see how a user would interact with your interface without any prior knowledge.</p>

This specifically came from chapter 7 of Don&#x27;t Make Me Think. I found this really interesting because the way it describes the speed at which users determine if a site is good enough. Immediately from first impressions, users determine if they like a design or not. And their impression of the site won&#x27;t change if they look at even more. I find this really facinating because I wouldn&#x27;t have expected that even though I know from my own experience that I do the same thing when opening a new site.</p>

Specifically, how you must have a positive relationship with the person first if you want to give them negative feedback that they will actually utilize. We discussed giving and recieving feedback in a leadership class I took last semester and I find that there is a lot of good overlap with this article. We discussed how you must &quot;be in the arena&quot; with someone if you want to give them feedback. Being in the arena simply means that you genuinely want what&#x27;s best for them and are trying to help them improve. This article essetially says the same thing which I think is really important to know especially when it comes to being in a leadership position.</p>

<p>This reading made me think a lot about whitespace. Whitespace is a very important tool when it comes to design and I think these portfolios make great use of it. Using whitespace helps direct the eye to the important things on the screen. It also allows for a less overwhelming experience. This article has shown me that I need to be sure to utilize whitespace intentially and percisely in my portfolio. Below I included an image of a portfolio example from the website that utilizes a large amount pf whitespace in a great way.</p>
