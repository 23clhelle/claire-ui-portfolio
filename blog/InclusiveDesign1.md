# Inclusive Design 1 Blog Post
This chapter brings awareness to accessibility on websites. Krug has a three-second accessibility test that he uses to quickly tell if a website is accessible. This test is simple, hence the name, and simply involves looking if you can make to site's text bigger. Having adjustable text size is a fairly simple implementation that greatly benefits users who need it.

Before:
<img src={require('@site/static/img/TeachFrontText1.png').default}/> 
\
After:
<img src={require('@site/static/img/TeachFrontText2.png').default}/> 

\
TeachFront is a great example of an interface that passes this test. TeachFront has the text icon in an obvious location that is consistent throughout all pages. The text growth feature works great and applies to all of the text on the website as you can see in the before and after pictures.
