# Feedback Workshop Blog Post

When reading this article, I was really struck by the information about giving feedback. Specifically, how you must have a positive relationship with the person first if you want to give them negative feedback that they will actually utilize. We discussed giving and recieving feedback in a leadership class I took last semester and I find that there is a lot of good overlap with this article. We discussed how you must "be in the arena" with someone if you want to give them feedback. Being in the arena simply means that you genuinely want what's best for them and are trying to help them improve. This article essetially says the same thing which I think is really important to know especially when it comes to being in a leadership position.
