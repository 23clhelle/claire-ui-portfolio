On Monday, in my UI/UX class, we had a UIUM Summit. Each student in the class chose a different population to represent for this mock negotiation. The prior week, we all presented the populations we were serving and what kind of needs they have. So, by Monday, we all had an idea of how we were going to negotiate the requirements of our hypothetical interface. 
I chose to represent the population that has dyslexia. Dyslexia is a condition that makes processing written words more difficult. So, I did some research on what an interface would need to help users with dyslexia. What I found was that they could benefit from sans-serif fonts, larger font sizes, simple backgrounds, large contrast levels, and text-to-speech functionality. 

So, back to the mock negotiation. My teacher sent out a slide show with different sections where we could add our requirements. The sections included a color scheme, menu, media, etc. I was quick to add my five requirements to the presentation. They were also in priority order, so since I was quick, they ended up being a high priority. However, there were times when the priorities got moved, but I always understood why they needed to be moved and I was able to easily prioritize the dyslexic population's needs because of my research. Then, my teacher gave us the challenge of limiting how many we could agree to add to the hypothetical website as a group. All of my requirements were included through some compromise except for the text-to-speech functionality, but that was mainly due to time constraints and because it was on the last slide. I was surprised to have the photosensitivity population agree with me on requirements, but when I thought about it, it made sense because of the high-contrast level requirement. It was hard to convince anxiety’s representative of my requirements because we didn’t have any overlap at the start. But, with time, they understood that some of the requirements were very necessary. 
	
While I will never be in this exact situation again, I learned some valuable insights from it. The main thing being how to reason with people who don’t have the same goals as you. I had to find a way to appeal to their emotions because I knew the logic wouldn’t benefit me in this situation. After a while of negotiation, I determined how to persuade the other representatives to add my requirements to the website. I’ll be able to use these persuasive tactics in many different situations in the future.
