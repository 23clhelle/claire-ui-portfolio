# Portfolios & Design Narratives Blog Post
Word: Whitespace

This reading made me think a lot about whitespace. Whitespace is a very important tool when it comes to design and I think these portfolios make great use of it. Using whitespace helps direct the eye to the important things on the screen. It also allows for a less overwhelming experience. This article has shown me that I need to be sure to utilize whitespace intentially and percisely in my portfolio. Below I included an image of a portfolio example from the website that utilizes a large amount pf whitespace in a great way.
