# Mockups Blog Post
Something that really stuck out to me when I was doing this reading was the Big Bang Theory of Web Design. This specifically came from chapter 7 of Don't Make Me Think. I found this really interesting because the way it describes the speed at which users determine if a site is good enough. Immediately from first impressions, users determine if they like a design or not. And their impression of the site won't change if they look at even more. I find this really facinating because I wouldn't have expected that even though I know from my own experience that I do the same thing when opening a new site.
