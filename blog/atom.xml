        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ORIGINAL
The original color scheme is pretty bland. Most of the interface is black, white, and gray with the exception of the image and some blue text indicating a link. So, this interface mostly follows the achromatic scheme. This scheme really helps to convey professionalism and sleekness from the company.</p>
<p>RECREATION</p>
<p>VERSION 1
I changed the colors to create a more magical interface. Violet is a great way of conveying a magical feeling so I chose to create a monochromatic look with violet.</p>
<p>VERSION 2
For this version, I changed the colors to make the interface more calm. Using the color light blue is a great way to emanate a calm feeling. I chose to use light tints of the three primary colors to create a cohesive interface that promoted a calm feeling.</p>
<p>VERSION 3
On the final version, I attempted to follow a rich color scheme. I wanted to focus on burgundy as the powerful hue and I paired it with its darkened complement of a forest green. This color scheme works to create a dramatic interface that is unforgettable.</p>
<p>I think the original version is the most effective because it’s color scheme is the most appealing to me. Apple is a very sleek, high-end company and I think the black and white color scheme does a great job of keeping the website professional. Adding the pop of color through the phones is nice because it draws the eye to the phones which are the star of the show. The user came to the site to look at accessories and they were able to see how a few accessories can be used on their phones.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Analogy: Signal is to noise as accessibility is to barriers.</p>
<p>You want a high signal to noise ratio, but it's important to acknowledge that in some circumstances noise is good. Noise can help convey the theme or message you are trying to get across. Just as accessibility is important almost always, but sometimes you need barriers to limit access. For instance, there are employee only sections in a store so you use a door as a barrier to separate that part of the store from the rest. Or in UI, there is a teacher side of canvas that you don't want students to have access to so you make a barrier at the log in screen to prevent students from seeing the teachers side. It's important for me to remember this in my career because I want to efficiently and effectively convey my message when designing things like presentations or even applications.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Section: Aspects of Color</p>
<p>Word: Manipulation</p>
<p>I chose manipulation to describe this section because it is all about identifying how colors affect and influence people. Not only do colors affect peoples' emotions, but they affect our physical health too. This can be our blood pressure, metabolism, and more. Designers can use this as a way of manipulating people who are viewing their product or brand. It's important for me to remember this in my career because anytime I make a presentation or a logo, I can use color to portray my message effectively. Simply using blue as a theme for my presentation can provide calming effects to my audience and me.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Section: Color Trends</p>
<p>Word: Social Media</p>
<p>Technically social media is two words but it's one thing so I'm going to count it anyway. This section made me think about social media a lot because of how it wrote about CAUS and tracking trends. They talk about having people visit places to determine what the popular fashion trends are to determine the color trends. This is a fairly old book though so I kept thinking about how social media would change the way they operate. Especially with the rise of influencers and celebrities, I feel like social media would be a very important, and probably more convenient way, to track trends and predict future color trends.</p>
