# Design Interviews Blog Post
What really captured me throughout watching these videos was just the general information provided about interviews. Interviews are very scary for me and I get really anxious when doing them, so I was excited to get incite about them. While the UI specific information is nice to know as well, there was a good amount of information that I can apply to any job interview. For instance, they provided tips for technical questions, but those types of questions aren't exclusive to UI. So, a lot of this information I will be able to apply to any job that I interview for.
