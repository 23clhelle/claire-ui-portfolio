# Navigation & Values Blog Post

This week, from Don’t Make Me Think, I read about navigation. I also read about values from Colin Brek’s blog. What really stuck out to me this week was the navigation hierarchy. When I think about websites I typically use, there’s normally a navigation bar at the top with subsections within it. However, once you navigate to a subsection, this hierarchy is no longer displayed, which is exactly what was pointed out in the chapter. While I find this inconsistency to be very frustrating, I can understand why it’s less important. Users will spend the majority of time on the pages towards the top of the hierarchy, making the lower levels less important.
