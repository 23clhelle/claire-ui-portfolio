<p>SteamStats. A helpful website that connects to users’ streaming services to provide usage and cost statistics. I decided to create this interface because I am a very logical person who loves to work with numbers. Streaming services stuck out to me because there has been a strong switch from cable to streaming applications. However, with time, the savings that streaming services originally provided have faded. Prices have increased for these subscriptions, and many people choose to buy more than one service so that they can access a larger library of shows. As a Data Science major, I was excited to incorporate visuals of the data collected.</p>
<p>To determine if this was actually an interface that people desired, I interviewed a couple of subjects on their feelings toward their streaming services. What I found was that people have MANY frustrations with the methods they use to watch TV. My two interviewees had at least five subscriptions at the time of the interview and they were overwhelmed with trying to keep track of all of them. Another thing I found was that for families with young children, it would be helpful to track how much television they are watching.</p>
<p>After these initial interviews, I knew StreamStats would be a beneficial resource for many families. I chose to create StreamStats as a website interface designed for computers. The main reason I went with a computer is because, typically, when people are budgeting, they are using a laptop. Also, a larger screen size would work better since I would need a lot of pixels to display some visuals.</p>
<p>Finally, I came up with some values that I wanted for the website. I chose clarity and consistency as my two main values. Clarity is important for my UI because the goal of my interface is to make a busy user’s life easier. I don’t want them to have to spend extra time and brain power trying to decipher my interface. Consistency is important for my UI because, like clarity, I don’t want to cause any confusion for my users. By having a consistent format throughout the different pages of my interface, users can easily understand what page they are on and what the consistent buttons do.</p>
<p>So, when it was time to actually begin designing, I started with some physical sketches. These are the original ideas I had come up with for the main screens that users would find beneficial.</p>

<p>From the beginning of my electronic mockups, I knew that I wanted StreamStats to follow a green color scheme. When I think of budgeting, I think of money, and what better way to create that connection than by making the website the color of American money (since this will be launched in the US). So, when it came time to make my first draft mockups, they looked fairly similar to my sketches but with better color and design. But before I could create the Figma version of my interface, I had to develop a design system. Some of the hardest decisions to make were choosing the best colors for the theme and what font family would be used. I ended up selecting lighter and darker shades of green for a monochromatic look, and then I chose the Roboto font because it is simple and sans-serif. I wanted a sans-serif font specifically, because it allows the interface to be more accessible. I also chose to add a drop shadow to all of my buttons because I thought it was a great signifier to tell the user that it was a clickable button. That is how I ended up with my design system:</p>

<iframe style="border:1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/design/FGe9WsZmnnLnajvzW2KdYq/SSS?node-id=32-125&amp;embed-host=share"></iframe>
<p>When the original prototype is opened in preview mode, it starts on the log-in screen. Users can then click the log-in button to navigate to the home page. From the home page, there are two options: users can select the usage button and navigate to the usage page, or they can select the cost button and navigate to the cost page. From either of those pages, users can simply click the logo in the top left corner to get back to the home page.</p>
<p>After I finished this prototype, I performed some user tests to get feedback. The first test was with one of my classmates. To navigate through a user test, I first had her examine the Figma prototype however she desired. Then, I asked her to perform a task: _____. I took notes throughout the entire process and found that there were some important changes I needed to make. There was a lot of uncertainty about what different things meant, and there wasn’t enough information provided. This was a major flaw because one of the main values of the interface is clarity. So, I made all of the changes that I discovered during the test and got this new prototype:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="first-prototype">First Prototype<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to First Prototype" title="Direct link to First Prototype" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/projects#first-prototype">​</a></h3>

<p>Now that I had an improved version, I was ready to perform more user tests. The next tests I performed followed the same format as the test I did in class, but this time, I used my original interviewees for it. Throughout the two separate tests, I found ten different struggles users had when navigating the interface. However, this time, I did not make changes to fix everything. When it came to clarity, I did make the changes because, once again, that was one of the main values, but I did not make changes to functionality. Specifically, both users wanted to type in the text input boxes, but due to the nature of the prototype, I didn’t feel that this was a necessary change to make. After these tests were complete, I made some more changes and ended with the following prototype:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="second-prototype">Second Prototype<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Second Prototype" title="Direct link to Second Prototype" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/projects#second-prototype">​</a></h3>
<iframe style="border:1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/design/FGe9WsZmnnLnajvzW2KdYq/StreamStats?node-id=112-74&amp;embed-host=share"></iframe>
<p>Finally, I got feedback from my professor and classmates on my prototype. Just like my user tests, my teacher went through and explored the website and followed a task. I collected a lot of feedback throughout the process, including some from my classmates. One of the main changes I needed to make was consistency in button formatting. Again, consistency is one of the values I had for my interface, so, I felt it was very important to make those changes. I also learned that I needed more information about the purpose of the website throughout. The largest change I made was adding a weekly breakdown view for the cost. This wasn’t the first time a user desired this, so I felt as though it would have a large enough impact for it to be worth it. So, I made the changes that I felt were necessary and ended up with this final prototype:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="final-prototype">Final Prototype<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Final Prototype" title="Direct link to Final Prototype" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/projects#final-prototype">​</a></h3>
<iframe style="border:1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/design/FGe9WsZmnnLnajvzW2KdYq/SSS?node-id=149-66&amp;embed-host=share"></iframe>
<p>This final version of StreamStats is much improved from the original version. Not only is the purpose clearer, but it also portrays the intended values much better. For clarity, I used obvious signifiers and text explanations on each page to make the purpose obvious. I also used a clear hierarchy of typography to make the level of importance of each piece of information clear. Again, I used different colors and shadows on buttons to show that they are clickable objects. For consistency, I used the same monochromatic color scheme across the entire website so that users wouldn’t think that have navigated to a new website (such as one of their streaming services). I also kept the site’s logo in the top left corner so that when users click it they are always brought to the home page. I also ensured the font family was the same throughout the website to provide a clear, clean look.</p></article></div><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/projects#streamstats">StreamStats</a><ul><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/projects#design-narrative">Design Narrative</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/projects#sketches">Sketches</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/projects#design-system">Design System</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/projects#mockups">Mockups</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/projects#first-prototype">First Prototype</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/projects#second-prototype">Second Prototype</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/projects#final-prototype">Final Prototype</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></main></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title"></div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/about-me">About Me</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title"></div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/projects">Projects</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title"></div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/claire-ui-portfolio/blog">Blog</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title"></div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/your-org/my-ui-portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 My UI Portfolio.
