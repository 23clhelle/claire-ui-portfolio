I also created it so that the most contrast was the bold black text on the light yellow background because that also draws the viewer's attention to that spot. I added wobbly lines separating the heading and footer from the body to reflect the natural curvature of a landscape. The purpose of this interface is to provide information about a landscaping company, so making it look like a landscape, helps convey that purpose.
