So, by Monday, we all had an idea of how we were going to negotiate the requirements of our hypothetical interface.\nI chose to represent the population that has dyslexia. Dyslexia is a condition that makes processing written words more difficult. So, I did some research on what an interface would need to help users with dyslexia. What I found was that they could benefit from sans-serif fonts, larger font sizes, simple backgrounds, large contrast levels, and text-to-speech functionality."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"So, back to the mock negotiation. My teacher sent out a slide show with different sections where we could add our requirements. The sections included a color scheme, menu, media, etc. I was quick to add my five requirements to the presentation. They were also in priority order, so since I was quick, they ended up being a high priority. However, there were times when the priorities got moved, but I always understood why they needed to be moved and I was able to easily prioritize the dyslexic population's needs because of my research. Then, my teacher gave us the challenge of limiting how many we could agree to add to the hypothetical website as a group. All of my requirements were included through some compromise except for the text-to-speech functionality, but that was mainly due to time constraints and because it was on the last slide. I was surprised to have the photosensitivity population agree with me on requirements, but when I thought about it, it made sense because of the high-contrast level requirement. It was hard to convince anxiety\u2019s representative of my requirements because we didn\u2019t have any overlap at the start. But, with time, they understood that some of the requirements were very necessary."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"While I will never be in this exact situation again, I learned some valuable insights from it.

After a while of negotiation, I determined how to persuade the other representatives to add my requirements to the website.
