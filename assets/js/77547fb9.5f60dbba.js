Each student in the class chose a different population to represent for this mock negotiation. The prior week, we all presented the populations we were serving and what kind of needs they have. So, by Monday, we all had an idea of how we were going to negotiate the requirements of our hypothetical interface. \\nI chose to represent the population that has dyslexia. Dyslexia is a condition that makes processing written words more difficult. So, I did some research on what an interface would need to help users with dyslexia. What I found was that they could benefit from sans-serif fonts, larger font sizes, simple backgrounds, large contrast levels, and text-to-speech functionality. \\n\\nSo, back to the mock negotiation. My teacher sent out a slide show with different sections where we could add our requirements. The sections included a color scheme, menu, media, etc. I was quick to add my five requirements to the presentation. They were also in priority order, so since I was quick, they ended up being a high priority. However, there were times when the priorities got moved, but I always understood why they needed to be moved and I was able to easily prioritize the dyslexic population\'s needs because of my research. Then, my teacher gave us the challenge of limiting how many we could agree to add to the hypothetical website as a group. All of my requirements were included through some compromise except for the text-to-speech functionality, but that was mainly due to time constraints and because it was on the last slide. I was surprised to have the photosensitivity population agree with me on requirements, but when I thought about it, it made sense because of the high-contrast level requirement. It was hard to convince anxiety\u2019s representative of my requirements because we didn\u2019t have any overlap at the start. But, with time, they understood that some of the requirements were very necessary. \\n\\t\\nWhile I will never be in this exact situation again, I learned some valuable insights from it. The main thing being how to reason with people who don\u2019t have the same goals as you. I had to find a way to appeal to their emotions because I knew the logic wouldn\u2019t benefit me in this situation. After a while of negotiation, I determined how to persuade the other representatives to add my requirements to the website. I\u2019ll be able to use these persuasive tactics in many different situations in the future."},{"id":"/inclusive-design-2-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/inclusive-design-2-blog-post","source":"@site/blog/InclusiveDesign2.md","title":"Inclusive Design 2 Blog Post","description":"In this chapter, one important piece of information in discusses is the four different kinds of constraints.

After viewing many different pieces of art, I was struck with inspiration when I saw the Barns and Farms piece.\\n![plot](Images/Barns_And_Farms.jpeg)\\n\\nBarns and Farms is an oil painting on canvas created in 1983. Richard Diebenkorn created the background of this piece, while Ed Ruscha added the text onto the top. The color blocks in the background represent the ocean and sand from the Los Angeles neighborhood where Diebenkorn grew up. Ruscha added the large, capital block letters to depict the agricultural structures he saw when driving from Oklahoma to California.\\n\\n\\nColor: \\\\\\nMost of the colors\u2019 values are darker, which is nice because it makes the lighter values stand out. These lighter values do a great job of making the painting look more realistic and like there is real light reflecting off of it. I also really like the color choices of blue and orange/yellow because they complement each other very well. Proven because they are true complimentary colors.\\\\\\nhttps://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/formal_analysis.html \\n\\nTextual: \\\\\\nBarns and Farms provides text that serves a clear purpose. The three words chosen, barns and farms, to be included are simple but do a great job of conveying the message about agriculture. I like that they are about agricultural structures while also rhyming. The harsh block letters are a great stylistic choice because they stand out while being blocky, like agricultural buildings (barns and farms). \\\\\\nhttps://jerwoodvisualarts.org/art-theory-glossary/textual-analysis-in-art/ \\n\\nVisual Balance: \\\\\\nMy eye is immediately drawn to the word barn because that is the largest color contrast of white on dark blue. After that, my eyes are drawn to the yellow/orange color because it is brighter and sticks out since the majority of the piece is dark. I think this does a great job of pointing out the two most important parts of the piece that help convey the meaning. \\\\\\nhttps://www.johnlovett.com/balance \\n\\n\\n![plot](Images/Art_Interface_Sketch.jpeg)\\nThis is the UI I decided to sketch based on the Barns and Farms art piece. This UI has mostly dark backgrounds except for where the heading is. I made the heading lighter to draw the eyes\' attention to that spot as the painting did. I also created it so that the most contrast was the bold black text on the light yellow background because that also draws the viewer\'s attention to that spot. I added wobbly lines separating the heading and footer from the body to reflect the natural curvature of a landscape. The purpose of this interface is to provide information about a landscaping company, so making it look like a landscape, helps convey that purpose. These design choices were all based on the aspects I noticed from the Barns and Farms painting. This UI could be used on just about any device, but given the shape I sketched the interface, it would match best with a computer screen. \\n\\nThroughout this process, I learned a lot about design. One noteworthy aspect was the connection between art and interface design. I never thought about how web pages and apps are a form of art.

This scheme really helps to convey professionalism and sleekness from the company.\\n\\nMy recreation of the interface:\\n![plot](Images/RecreationApple.png)\\n\\nColor scheme version 1:\\n![plot](Images/Version1Apple.png)\\nI changed the colors to create a more magical interface. Violet is a great way of conveying a magical feeling so I chose to create a monochromatic look with violet.\\n\\nColor scheme version 2:\\n![plot](Images/Version2Apple.png)\\nFor this version, I changed the colors to make the interface more calm. Using the color light blue is a great way to emanate a calm feeling. I chose to use light tints of the three primary colors to create a cohesive interface that promoted a calm feeling.\\n\\nColor scheme version 3:\\n![plot](Images/Version3Apple.png)\\nOn the final version, I attempted to follow a rich color scheme. I wanted to focus on burgundy as the powerful hue and I paired it with its darkened complement of a forest green. This color scheme works to create a dramatic interface that is unforgettable. \\n\\nConclusion:\\nI think the original version is the most effective because it\u2019s color scheme is the most appealing to me. Apple is a very sleek, high-end company and I think the black and white color scheme does a great job of keeping the website professional. Adding the pop of color through the phones is nice because it draws the eye to the phones which are the star of the show. The user came to the site to look at accessories and they were able to see how a few accessories can be used on their phones."},{"id":"/AestheticDesign-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/AestheticDesign-blog-post","source":"@site/blog/AestheticDesign.md","title":"Aesthetic Design Blog Post","description":"Analogy: Signal is to noise as accessibility is to barriers.","date":"2024-09-19T15:30:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"ApproximateAnalogy","permalink":"/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/approximateanalogy","description":"Write an analogy based on a topic in the reading and explain why the concept is important to remember in your career."}],"readingTime":0.9,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Aesthetic Design Blog Post","slug":"/AestheticDesign-blog-post","date":"2024-09-19T15:30:00.000Z","tags":["approximateanalogy"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Color Study","permalink":"/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/ColorStudy-blog-post"},"nextItem":{"title":"Colors 1 Blog Post","permalink":"/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/colors1-blog-post"}},"content":"Analogy: Signal is to noise as accessibility is to barriers.\\n\\nYou want a high signal to noise ratio, but it\'s important to acknowledge that in some circumstances noise is good. Noise can help convey the theme or message you are trying to get across. Just as accessibility is important almost always, but sometimes you need barriers to limit access. For instance, there are employee only sections in a store so you use a door as a barrier to separate that part of the store from the rest. Or in UI, there is a teacher side of canvas that you don\'t want students to have access to so you make a barrier at the log in screen to prevent students from seeing the teachers side. It\'s important for me to remember this in my career because I want to efficiently and effectively convey my message when designing things like presentations or even applications.\\n\\nSignal Noise Ratio Royalty-Free Images, Stock Photos & Pictures |  Shutterstock\\n\\nReynolds, Garr.

Not only do colors affect peoples\' emotions, but they affect our physical health too. This can be our blood pressure, metabolism, and more. Designers can use this as a way of manipulating people who are viewing their product or brand. It\'s important for me to remember this in my career because anytime I make a presentation or a logo, I can use color to portray my message effectively. Simply using blue as a theme for my presentation can provide calming effects to my audience and me.\\n\\nColor Stock Photos, Royalty Free Color Images | Depositphotos\\n\\nSutton, Tina, and Bride M.

This section made me think about social media a lot because of how it wrote about CAUS and tracking trends. They talk about having people visit places to determine what the popular fashion trends are to determine the color trends. This is a fairly old book though so I kept thinking about how social media would change the way they operate. Especially with the rise of influencers and celebrities, I feel like social media would be a very important, and probably more convenient way, to track trends and predict future color trends.\\n\\nStock trends Stock Photos, Royalty Free Stock trends Images | Depositphotos\\n\\nSutton, Tina, and Bride M.
