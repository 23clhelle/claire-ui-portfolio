Noise can help convey the theme or message you are trying to get across. Just as accessibility is important almost always, but sometimes you need barriers to limit access. For instance, there are employee only sections in a store so you use a door as a barrier to separate that part of the store from the rest. Or in UI, there is a teacher side of canvas that you don\'t want students to have access to so you make a barrier at the log in screen to prevent students from seeing the teachers side. It\'s important for me to remember this in my career because I want to efficiently and effectively convey my message when designing things like presentations or even applications. :|\\n\\nSignal Noise Ratio Royalty-Free Images, Stock Photos & Pictures |  Shutterstock\\n\\nReynolds, Garr.

Not only do colors affect peoples\' emotions, but they affect our physical health too. This can be our blood pressure, metabolism, and more. Designers can use this as a way of manipulating people who are viewing their product or brand. It\'s important for me to remember this in my career because anytime I make a presentation or a logo, I can use color to portray my message effectively. Simply using blue as a theme for my presentation can provide calming effects to my audience and me.\\n\\nColor Stock Photos, Royalty Free Color Images | Depositphotos\\n\\nSutton, Tina, and Bride M.

This section made me think about social media a lot because of how it wrote about CAUS and tracking trends. They talk about having people visit places to determine what the popular fashion trends are to determine the color trends. This is a fairly old book though so I kept thinking about how social media would change the way they operate. Especially with the rise of influencers and celebrities, I feel like social media would be a very important, and probably more convenient way, to track trends and predict future color trends.\\n\\nStock trends Stock Photos, Royalty Free Stock trends Images | Depositphotos\\n\\nSutton, Tina, and Bride M.
