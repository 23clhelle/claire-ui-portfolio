Noise can help convey the theme or message you are trying to get across. Just as accessibility is important almost always, but sometimes you need barriers to limit access. For instance, there are employee only sections in a store so you use a door as a barrier to separate that part of the store from the rest. Or in UI, there is a teacher side of canvas that you don't want students to have access to so you make a barrier at the log in screen to prevent students from seeing the teachers side. It's important for me to remember this in my career because I want to efficiently and effectively convey my message when designing things like presentations or even applications."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Signal Noise Ratio Royalty-Free Images, Stock Photos & Pictures |  Shutterstock"}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["Reynolds, Garr.
