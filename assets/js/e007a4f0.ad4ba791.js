A helpful website that connects to users\u2019 streaming services to provide usage and cost statistics. I decided to create this interface because I am a very logical person who loves to work with numbers. Streaming services stuck out to me because there has been a strong switch from cable to streaming applications. However, with time, the savings that streaming services originally provided have faded. Prices have increased for these subscriptions, and many people choose to buy more than one service so that they can access a larger library of shows. As a Data Science major, I was excited to incorporate visuals of the data collected. I'm also a very logical person, so in combination with major, I knew a logical interface would be perfect for me to design."}),(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"To determine if this was actually an interface that people desired, I interviewed a couple of subjects on their feelings toward their streaming services. What I found was that people have MANY frustrations with the methods they use to watch TV.

Another thing I found was that for families with young children, it would be helpful to track how much television they are watching."}),(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"After these initial interviews, I knew StreamStats would be a beneficial resource for many families.

Also, a larger screen size would work better since I would need a lot of pixels to display some visuals."}),(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"To help me create StreamStats, I created a story about a hypothetical user.

Each kid is at a different point in school: college, high school, and middle school. Mary has worked in health care her entire adult life, over 20 years. Since she is also on the school\u2019s PTA board, Mary has very little free time. Mary is essentially responsible for running the entire household because her husband has to leave on work trips a lot. Mary doesn\u2019t have much free time, but when she does, she loves to spend it with her family.

StreamStats allows Mary to keep track of her expenses and usage when it comes to television."}),(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Finally, I came up with some values that I wanted for the website. I chose clarity and consistency as my two main values. Clarity is important for my UI because the goal of my interface is to make a busy user\u2019s life easier. Thinking back to Mary, she doesn't have extra time to try to decipher my interface. Consistency is important for my UI because, like clarity, I don\u2019t want to cause any confusion for my users.

When I think of budgeting, I think of money, and what better way to create that connection than by making the website the color of American money (since this will be launched in the US). So, when it came time to make my first draft mockups, they looked fairly similar to my sketches but with better color and design. But before I could create the Figma version of my interface, I had to develop a design system. Some of the hardest decisions to make were choosing the best colors for the theme and what font family would be used. I ended up selecting lighter and darker shades of green for a monochromatic look, and then I chose the Roboto font because it is simple and sans-serif. I wanted a sans-serif font specifically, because it allows the interface to be more accessible. I also chose to add a drop shadow to all of my buttons because I thought it was a great signifier to tell the user that it was a clickable button.

When it came to clarity problems, I did make the changes because, once again, that was one of the main values, but I did not make changes to functionality. Specifically, both users wanted to type in the text input boxes, but due to the nature of the prototype, I didn\u2019t feel that this was a necessary change to make. After these tests were complete, these were the main changes I made: the usage chart to clearly show the current month\u2019s usage, The cost chart to appear on a separate page for enhanced visualization, and back arrows on pages to make navigation even easier.

I also learned that I needed more information about the purpose of the website throughout. The largest change I made was adding a weekly breakdown view for the cost.

Again, I used different colors and shadows on buttons to show that they are clickable objects. For consistency, I used the same monochromatic color scheme across the entire website so that users wouldn\u2019t think that have navigated to a new website (such as one of their streaming services).
