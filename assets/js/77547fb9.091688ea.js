After viewing many different pieces of art, I was struck with inspiration when I saw the Barns and Farms piece.\\n![plot](Images/Barns_And_Farms.jpeg)\\n\\nBarns and Farms is an oil painting on canvas created in 1983. Richard Diebenkorn created the background of this piece, while Ed Ruscha added the text onto the top. The color blocks in the background represent the ocean and sand from the Los Angeles neighborhood where Diebenkorn grew up. Ruscha added the large, capital block letters to depict the agricultural structures he saw when driving from Oklahoma to California.\\n\\n\\nColor: \\\\\\nMost of the colors\u2019 values are darker, which is nice because it makes the lighter values stand out. These lighter values do a great job of making the painting look more realistic and like there is real light reflecting off of it. I also really like the color choices of blue and orange/yellow because they complement each other very well. Proven because they are true complimentary colors.\\\\\\nhttps://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/formal_analysis.html \\n\\nTextual: \\\\\\nBarns and Farms provides text that serves a clear purpose. The three words chosen, barns and farms, to be included are simple but do a great job of conveying the message about agriculture. I like that they are about agricultural structures while also rhyming. The harsh block letters are a great stylistic choice because they stand out while being blocky, like agricultural buildings (barns and farms). \\\\\\nhttps://jerwoodvisualarts.org/art-theory-glossary/textual-analysis-in-art/ \\n\\nVisual Balance: \\\\\\nMy eye is immediately drawn to the word barn because that is the largest color contrast of white on dark blue. After that, my eyes are drawn to the yellow/orange color because it is brighter and sticks out since the majority of the piece is dark. I think this does a great job of pointing out the two most important parts of the piece that help convey the meaning. \\\\\\nhttps://www.johnlovett.com/balance \\n\\n\\n![plot](Images/Art_Interface_Sketch.jpeg)\\nThis is the UI I decided to sketch based on the Barns and Farms art piece. This UI has mostly dark backgrounds except for where the heading is. I made the heading lighter to draw the eyes\' attention to that spot as the painting did. I also created it so that the most contrast was the bold black text on the light yellow background because that also draws the viewer\'s attention to that spot. I added wobbly lines separating the heading and footer from the body to reflect the natural curvature of a landscape. The purpose of this interface is to provide information about a landscaping company, so making it look like a landscape, helps convey that purpose. These design choices were all based on the aspects I noticed from the Barns and Farms painting. This UI could be used on just about any device, but given the shape I sketched the interface, it would match best with a computer screen. \\n\\nThroughout this process, I learned a lot about design. One noteworthy aspect was the connection between art and interface design. I never thought about how web pages and apps are a form of art. When designing these interfaces, the designer has to think about the aspects of art that they can incorporate to better communicate their message."},{"id":"/design-systems-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/design-systems-blog-post","source":"@site/blog/DesignSystems.md","title":"Design Systems Blog Post","description":"Through reading several articles from designsystems.com, I learned about many different design strategies.

The following blog dives into what makes the interface look good and other potential color schemes it could use.\\n\\nThe original interface:\\n![plot](Images/OriginalApple.png)\\nThe original color scheme is pretty bland. Most of the interface is black, white, and gray with the exception of the image and some blue text indicating a link. So, this interface mostly follows the achromatic scheme. This scheme really helps to convey professionalism and sleekness from the company.\\n\\nMy recreation of the interface:\\n![plot](Images/RecreationApple.png)\\n\\nColor scheme version 1:\\n![plot](Images/Version1Apple.png)\\nI changed the colors to create a more magical interface. Violet is a great way of conveying a magical feeling so I chose to create a monochromatic look with violet.\\n\\nColor scheme version 2:\\n![plot](Images/Version2Apple.png)\\nFor this version, I changed the colors to make the interface more calm. Using the color light blue is a great way to emanate a calm feeling. I chose to use light tints of the three primary colors to create a cohesive interface that promoted a calm feeling.\\n\\nColor scheme version 3:\\n![plot](Images/Version3Apple.png)\\nOn the final version, I attempted to follow a rich color scheme. I wanted to focus on burgundy as the powerful hue and I paired it with its darkened complement of a forest green. This color scheme works to create a dramatic interface that is unforgettable. \\n\\nConclusion:\\nI think the original version is the most effective because it\u2019s color scheme is the most appealing to me. Apple is a very sleek, high-end company and I think the black and white color scheme does a great job of keeping the website professional. Adding the pop of color through the phones is nice because it draws the eye to the phones which are the star of the show. The user came to the site to look at accessories and they were able to see how a few accessories can be used on their phones."},{"id":"/AestheticDesign-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/AestheticDesign-blog-post","source":"@site/blog/AestheticDesign.md","title":"Aesthetic Design Blog Post","description":"Analogy: Signal is to noise as accessibility is to barriers.","date":"2024-09-19T15:30:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"ApproximateAnalogy","permalink":"/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/approximateanalogy","description":"Write an analogy based on a topic in the reading and explain why the concept is important to remember in your career."}],"readingTime":0.9,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Aesthetic Design Blog Post","slug":"/AestheticDesign-blog-post","date":"2024-09-19T15:30:00.000Z","tags":["approximateanalogy"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Color Study","permalink":"/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/ColorStudy-blog-post"},"nextItem":{"title":"Colors 1 Blog Post","permalink":"/claire-ui-portfolio/blog/colors1-blog-post"}},"content":"Analogy: Signal is to noise as accessibility is to barriers.\\n\\nYou want a high signal to noise ratio, but it\'s important to acknowledge that in some circumstances noise is good. Noise can help convey the theme or message you are trying to get across. Just as accessibility is important almost always, but sometimes you need barriers to limit access. For instance, there are employee only sections in a store so you use a door as a barrier to separate that part of the store from the rest. Or in UI, there is a teacher side of canvas that you don\'t want students to have access to so you make a barrier at the log in screen to prevent students from seeing the teachers side.
