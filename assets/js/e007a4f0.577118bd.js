A helpful website that connects to users\u2019 streaming services to provide usage and cost statistics. I decided to create this interface because I am a very logical person who loves to work with numbers. Streaming services stuck out to me because there has been a strong switch from cable to streaming applications. However, with time, the savings that streaming services originally provided have faded. Prices have increased for these subscriptions, and many people choose to buy more than one service so that they can access a larger library of shows. As a Data Science major, I was excited to incorporate visuals of the data collected."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"To determine if this was actually an interface that people desired, I interviewed a couple of subjects on their feelings toward their streaming services. What I found was that people have MANY frustrations with the methods they use to watch TV.

Another thing I found was that for families with young children, it would be helpful to track how much television they are watching."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"After these initial interviews, I knew StreamStats would be a beneficial resource for many families. I chose to create StreamStats as a website interface designed for computers. The main reason I went with a computer is because, typically, when people are budgeting, they are using a laptop. Also, a larger screen size would work better since I would need a lot of pixels to display some visuals."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Finally, I came up with some values that I wanted for the website. I chose clarity and consistency as my two main values. Clarity is important for my UI because the goal of my interface is to make a busy user\u2019s life easier. I don\u2019t want them to have to spend extra time and brain power trying to decipher my interface. Consistency is important for my UI because, like clarity, I don\u2019t want to cause any confusion for my users. By having a consistent format throughout the different pages of my interface, users can easily understand what page they are on and what the consistent buttons do."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"So, when it was time to actually begin designing, I started with some physical sketches.

When I think of budgeting, I think of money, and what better way to create that connection than by making the website the color of American money (since this will be launched in the US). So, when it came time to make my first draft mockups, they looked fairly similar to my sketches but with better color and design. But before I could create the Figma version of my interface, I had to develop a design system. Some of the hardest decisions to make were choosing the best colors for the theme and what font family would be used. I ended up selecting lighter and darker shades of green for a monochromatic look, and then I chose the Roboto font because it is simple and sans-serif. I wanted a sans-serif font specifically, because it allows the interface to be more accessible. I also chose to add a drop shadow to all of my buttons because I thought it was a great signifier to tell the user that it was a clickable button.

The first test was with one of my classmates. To navigate through a user test, I first had her examine the Figma prototype however she desired. Then, I asked her to perform a task: _____. I took notes throughout the entire process and found that there were some important changes I needed to make. There was a lot of uncertainty about what different things meant, and there wasn\u2019t enough information provided. This was a major flaw because one of the main values of the interface is clarity. So, I made all of the changes that I discovered during the test and got this new prototype:"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"first-prototype",children:"First Prototype"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)("iframe",{style:{border:"1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"},width:"800",height:"450",src:"https://embed.figma.com/design/FGe9WsZmnnLnajvzW2KdYq/SSS?node-id=73-74&embed-host=share",allowfullscreen:!0}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now that I had an improved version, I was ready to perform more user tests. The next tests I performed followed the same format as the test I did in class, but this time, I used my original interviewees for it. Throughout the two separate tests, I found ten different struggles users had when navigating the interface. However, this time, I did not make changes to fix everything. When it came to clarity, I did make the changes because, once again, that was one of the main values, but I did not make changes to functionality. Specifically, both users wanted to type in the text input boxes, but due to the nature of the prototype, I didn\u2019t feel that this was a necessary change to make.

Just like my user tests, my teacher went through and explored the website and followed a task. I collected a lot of feedback throughout the process, including some from my classmates. One of the main changes I needed to make was consistency in button formatting. Again, consistency is one of the values I had for my interface, so, I felt it was very important to make those changes. I also learned that I needed more information about the purpose of the website throughout. The largest change I made was adding a weekly breakdown view for the cost. This wasn\u2019t the first time a user desired this, so I felt as though it would have a large enough impact for it to be worth it. So, I made the changes that I felt were necessary and ended up with this final prototype:"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"final-prototype",children:"Final Prototype"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)("iframe",{style:{border:"1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"},width:"800",height:"450",src:"https://embed.figma.com/design/FGe9WsZmnnLnajvzW2KdYq/SSS?node-id=149-66&embed-host=share",allowfullscreen:!0}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This final version of StreamStats is much improved from the original version. Not only is the purpose clearer, but it also portrays the intended values much better. For clarity, I used obvious signifiers and text explanations on each page to make the purpose obvious. I also used a clear hierarchy of typography to make the level of importance of each piece of information clear. Again, I used different colors and shadows on buttons to show that they are clickable objects. For consistency, I used the same monochromatic color scheme across the entire website so that users wouldn\u2019t think that have navigated to a new website (such as one of their streaming services). I also kept the site\u2019s logo in the top left corner so that when users click it they are always brought to the home page.
